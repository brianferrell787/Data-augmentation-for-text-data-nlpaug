            "EFFECTS OF THE SELF- DETERMINED LEARNING MODEL OF INSTRUCTION ON GOAL ATTAINMENT AND SELF-DETERMINATION FOR STUDENTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. , The student investigator and PI will have regularly scheduled meetings by phone on the first day of each month to discussion progression of the study. The student investigator has the email address and phone number of the PI for scheduled meetings, and if any problems arise with the research. The student investigator and research assistant are responsible for the research related duties and functions. , By examining evidence and research-based practices for students with disabilities, researchers can identify how effective strategies can be implemented in the future for students with autism. In a recent study of the relationship between self-determination and postschool outcomes using a large sample size (712) of students with disabilities, education in self-determination lead to better outcomes in employment and community access. The study measured participants over a period of two school years and evaluated the efficacy of the SDLMI and other interventions in secondary education (Shogren, Wehmeyer, Plamer, Rifenbark & Little, 2015). Participants were initially acquired for a longitudinal study measuring self-determination and the impact of interventions in postsecondary education, and then again for postschool outcomes (Wehmeyer et al., 2012; Wehmeyer et al., 2013). The relationship between self-determined behavior one year after exiting revealed self-determination impacts adult outcomes. Limitations were largely the lack of effective evaluation of postsecondary education, limited understanding of how education affected employment outcomes and no outcome information about peers who did not participate in the intervention research (Shogren et al., 2015). The effect of the SDLMI on academic and transition goal attainment and access to general education curriculum in a large sample of students with learning and intellectual disabilities, indicated the intervention had significant impacts on goal attainment (Wehmeyer, Shogren, Palmer, William-Diehm, Little, & Boulton, 2012). In an efficacy study of the impact of the SDLMI on student self-determination, higher levels of self-determination were indicated after exposure to the SDLMI intervention. the sample consisted of high school students with intellectual disabilities in a group randomized, control group experiment, and measured the impact between groups from years 1 and 2 (Wehmeyer et al., 2012). The effect of the model on access to the general education curriculum and academic and transition goal attainment for a large sample of students with learning and intellectual disabilities, indicated self-determination had a significant impact on goal attainment as measured by the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) (Shogren, Palmer, Wehmeyer, William Diehm, & Little, 2012). Shogren and colleagues also evaluated teacher perceptions for students capacity using the SDLMI model. They found that when teachers are supported with implementation of the model, significant increases in teacher perception of student capacity and self-determination were present (Shogren, Wehmeyer, Palmer, Plotme, & Paek, 2014). Summary descriptions of the SDLMI studies reviewed here and accompanying results are in the attached table titled Literature Review Results. Continued education and employment are typical next steps after high school, however students with autism have low participation in both activities (Shattuck, Narendorf et al., 2012; Newman et al., 2011; Hendricks & Wehman, 2009) even with secondary programming in place for students with disabilities and legislative mandates to proactively address activities after high school. By 2018, roughly two-thirds of all employment with require some level of college education (Carnevale, Smith, & Strohl, 2010). The U.S. Department of Education (2016) indicates nearly 60% of students with disabilities who attend postsecondary institutions, attend community colleges in two-year programs or less than two years (degree-seeking or non-degree seeking). Enrollment in a community college often does not lead to a degree indicated by Bailey and colleagues (2006). Using the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, between 10- 30% of community college students earned degrees (Bailey et al., 2006). Many students enroll in community colleges intend to learn a skill, not may not peruse obtaining a degree. Students with disabilities, and more specifically autism, may require additional time to develop vocational skills and interact with others in an educational setting to become more independent and responsible in determining their own learning course (Alpern, 2007). Long-term success for students with disabilities is influenced by enrollment in, and completion of, a postsecondary education program (Newman et al., 2011). In a study on academic coaching and self-regulation for students with disabilities, students self-reported and identified having someone to talk to, time management, and study strategies, for reasons to attend coaching sessions to identify their focus of need, support and strategies for problem solving, and helping them identify resources and develop action plans (Mitchell & Gansemer-Top, 2016). Curriculum courses provide opportunities for career exploration and development, and inclusion in an educational setting with same-age peers to facilitate social and behavioral skills. Curriculum and continuing education programs prepare individuals for employment and assist in development of skills for personal and community enrichment, and workforce development. Technical and vocational programs encourage the use of hands-on learning and services aimed at the attainment of occupational skills sets in identified areas of instruction, such as information technologies. Many technical and vocational departments implement the use of practical education, modern technologies, and career training to gain work experience in different career tracks, fields, industries, and trades. Autism- Specific Supports in Postsecondary EducationAutism support in postsecondary education is similar to supported employment for individuals with disabilities. In supported employment, individuals with disabilities require and receive ongoing support to perform their job duties, and in the case of postsecondary education, individuals receive supports to create and perform steps and responsibilities to attain educational goals. Just as supported employment creates an inclusive employment opportunity for people with disabilities to earn competitive pay for real work; postsecondary education with autism-specific supports provides continuous postsecondary assistance for inclusive educational opportunities to prepare for employment. Supported employment has shown significant effects for improvement in acquisition of entry-level jobs and increases in income for people with disabilities (Wehman, et al., 2012). Postsecondary education with autism supports including self-determination curriculum, has the potential to parallel this process in higher educational environments to prepare for employment. Intervention implemented in postsecondary course settings using the SDLMI to guide instructional strategies will increase vocational self-determination and subsequent goal attainment through goal setting, constructing a learning plan, and adjusting behaviors to meet the goal. The student will self-monitor their own learning using goal attainment scaling. Factors related to self-determination, motivation, behavior, autism challenges, and support intensity will be examined during the intervention. ]. Determining how students with disabilities benefit from these identified strategies in postsecondary education provides an area of research to determine if a connection can also be made to students with autism spectrum disorders. Occupational and vocational courses are established as research-based practices for students with disabilities, and work-based learning through community-based instruction (Test et al., 2009). More research is needed to tie the strategies together in student-focused planning and self-determination of postsecondary goals. More intervention research identifying strategies that are associated with improved outcomes and causal relationships would be valuable in replication of current intervention studies in postsecondary educational settings. Available supports for students with disabilities in PSE are limited to accommodations that cause undue hardships to the institution, such as the assistance of a human aide. With the development of self-determined behaviors, students with autism may be able to more independently focus on their future goals and objectives through setting goals and self-monitoring, decreasing the need for human aide in classroom settings. Perhaps there is an accommodation between human aide and no support in class that would allow colleges to address the characteristics of autism as they relate to non-academic areas of instruction during the instruction and completion of assignment in academic and vocational areas. There needs to be increased evidence to show that self-determination increases postsecondary outcomes; the purpose of this study is to determine if self-determination instruction improves vocational and academic goal attainment and self-determined behavior, while decreasing support needs for this specific group of students with autism attending higher education courses. Measurement of intrinsic motivation and self-reported task evaluation has the potential to strengthen the outcomes of the intervention. The SDLMI intervention has not been used in higher education, and this study examines the effects in the community college setting. Even though the SDLMI studies reviewed here use similar dependent measures between such as GAS (Shogren et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2008; McLashing- Johnson et al., 2003; Agran, Blanchard, & Wehmeyer, 2000; Wehmeyer et al., 2000) and percentage data (Agran et al., 2010; Agran et al., 2006; Benitez et al., 2005; McLashing-Johnson et al., 2003; Agran, Blanchard, & Wehmeyer, 2000) participant characteristics and tasks significantly varied across research studies, making it difficult to compare results. The current study provides descriptive background data, individualized education information, and psychological evaluations; allowing extensive comparisons between participants. They represent a wide range of skills and abilities, strengthening sample variability, whereas other studies using this intervention did not provide consistent reporting of participant characteristics and relied heavily on students of the same disability categories to have greater generalizability. Transition goals have been the focus of research using the SDLMI (Shogren et al., 2013; Shogren et al, 2012; Finn et al., 2008; McLashing-Johnson, 2003; Agran, Blanchard, & Wehmeyer, 2000) and the current study will provide increased research in postsecondary settings for students with autism spectrum disorder. , Student participants receive educational support at a community college from the researcher and research assistant. The potential participants have established relationships with the researcher and research assistant through the support services non-profit organization. If the selected participants do not want to participate in the dissertation research, there are other students who would possibly be willing, so there is not pressure to participate. Participants' professors for the interviews will be approached in person, and reminded through email if they would like to participate in questions regarding student achievement in their courses. , The aim of the study is threefold: to increase academic and vocational goal-attainment in postsecondary settings in individual college coursework in associate, diploma, or certificate-seeking programs using the SDLMI intervention measured by achievement of independently completed task analyses percentages, increases in self-determined behaviors measured formally with a scale of self-determination consistent with SDLMI literature (Shogren et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2008; Wehmeyer, Palmer et al., 2000), and decreased support needs assessed by pre- and post-measurement of support intensity. Support intensity measurement has previously been used for students with autism in internship placements during secondary education (Wehman, Schall, et al., 2014). The researcher will determine if the SDLMI in a higher education setting, provides a strategy to increase involvement in academic and vocational goal setting, decision-making, and attainment. Using a model of self-determination, the SDLMI, an evidence-based practice in transition literature and student development, and autism specific services and supports, the proposed study seeks to demonstrate how students with autism can create and meet self-directed goals and education-related activities through learning and utilizing self-determined behavior. The intervention includes student questions, teacher objectives, and educational supports. Evidence-based self-determination transition practices in secondary educational settings (Test et al., 2009) have the potential to benefit students with disabilities, and more specifically autism, in postsecondary education settings and self-determined attainment of goals. Factors related to self-determination and motivation in the proposed study are present in formal pre and post data collection and measurement, decreased intensity of support, and informal observations of behaviors throughout the study phases.\n",
            "Piloting a teacher-delivered model of a personality-targeted substance use prevention intervention for adolescents , Prior to the beginning of the study, a meeting will take place with the PI, Dr. Thomson (trained in the 'train-the-trainer' model of Preventure), the community partner, and all school staff involved to finalize plans for the baseline and follow-up assessments, the intervention, and discuss any issues. Following this, communication will primarily take place via email and/or phone conversations as needed, with quarterly in-person meetings scheduled. The school staff will be instructed to inform the PI of any problems with the study via email or phone. , This project aims to pilot a personality-based prevention intervention, delivered by school staff (teachers and counselors). Risky substance use among adolescents is widespread, with rates of substance use more than doubling between adolescence and young adulthood, underscoring the critical nature of this transitional period. Despite the significant rate of substance use problems in students, very few seek or receive treatment. Accordingly, effective interventions to prevent and intervene in substance use problems are needed. , Teachers will make announcements in class to inform the students about the study (see scripts for study announcement). Announcements will be made at least twice, to make sure that students who may have been absent hear about the study. All assenting students, regardless of risk status or whether they will participate in the intervention, will be assessed at baseline and followed-up at 3-, and 6-months post-intervention. Assessments will be conducted with REDCap on VCU-owned tablets in a classroom or assembly format during school hours. Responses to the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale will determine personality risk status. , The studys first aim is to test the feasibility of implementing a teacher-delivered format of Preventure using ITT principles, with previous studies showing ITT efficacy when 75% of high risk students were delivered the intervention. We aim to evaluate the resources required for this level of implementation.The studys second aim is to assess the treatment fidelity of the teacher-delivered format of Preventure using the Preventure Intervention Fidelity and Adherence (PIFA) Scale. The studys third aim consists of three sub-aims: (1) Determine the feasibility of assessing the standard primary (alcohol and drug use and misuse) and secondary (mental health symptoms) Preventure outcomes with entire 7th and 9th grade cohorts at baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (6- and 12-month post-intervention); (2) Determine the feasibility of assessing novel neurocognitive proximal outcomes, such as delay discounting, a transdiagnostic neurocognitive endophenotype of primary etiological significance for SUDs; and (3) Determine the estimates of recruitment, retention, and adherence for a larger and sufficiently powered NIH-funded trial, which will be the first RCT with Preventure in the United States.\n",
            "Vision 21: Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth , Training:All pilot site staff will be required to participate in a full-day, in-person training and a half-day follow-up training administered by Vision 21: LSC project staff. During this training, Vision 21: LSC staff will discuss expectations of pilot site participation, including but not limited to: a) Vision and benefit(s) of the project,b) Purpose of the screening tool, c) How to administer and score the screening tool,d) Purpose of the training manual and how to use the training manual,e) Roles and responsibilities of pilot site staff, f) Roles and responsibilities of Vision 21: LSC project staff, g) Training and technical assistance (TTA) available to pilot sites from the Vision 21: LSC staff, andh) Human subjects protection ethical training. Because Vision 21: LSC project staff would like to receive feedback on the in-person training delivered to pilot sites, pilot site staff will be asked to complete a pre- and post-evaluation survey (Appendices A and B). Prior to the in-person training, pilot site staff will be asked to register for the in-person training via an online link. At this time, pilot site staff will also be asked to complete a brief online pre-survey (See Appendix A). In the pre-survey, pilot site staff will be asked about their (a) understanding of the Vision 21: LSC project, (b) previous training and general knowledge about victimization, and (c) organizations current screening process. In the post-survey, pilot site will be asked about their (a) understanding of the Vision 21: LSC project (including their confidence on administering the screening tool), (b) knowledge on the impact of victimization, (c) interest in training and technical assistance (TTA) from the Vision 21: LSC project staff, (d) knowledge of the ethical principles of human subjects protection and (e) feedback on how the training could be improved in the future. This post-survey will be conducted at the conclusion of the full-day training.In order to link responses between the pre and post surveys without having pilot site staff identify themselves, the first four questions of each survey will gather information that will create a code that is not personally identifiable (see Appendices A & B). The code allows responses to remain anonymous to the researchers while still being able to match surveys between pre and post administrations. A consent form for pilot site staff to include this information as part of the research is attached. Any pilot site staff who will be administering the screening tool will be required to participate in this in-person training. Pilot site staff who complete the training will receive a certificate of attendance for their participation.Communication:Communication between sites will occur primarily via email. Periodic team meetings and/or phone conversations will occur weekly. Study staff will visit the pilot sites physically once per month. , The importance of the knowledge to be gained from this study involves pinpointing specific barriers for care that may exist in communities between different sites. Further, it will develop a comprehensive victimization screen that can be used across systems so that individuals do not have to be re-screened at every agency with which they come into contact. , Participants will be recruited into the study by virtue of seeking services or being referred for services at one of the agencies participating in the study (i.e., Ready Kids, Shelter for Help in Emergency, Foothills Child Advocacy Center (CAC), Albemarle County Department of Social Services (DSS), Abuse Alternatives, Inc., Court Service Unit (CSU), Charlottesville Department of Juvenile Justice, Department of Social Services - Child Protective Services (CPS), Center for Child and Family Services -THRIVE program, Newport News Department of Human Services, Hampton Healthy Families, Alexandria Health Department Teen Wellness Center, Center for Alexandria's Children, Child Protective Services, and 18th District Juvenile & Domestic Relations Court Service Unit). No special solicitation of participants will occur outside of this regular referral flow. In order for each child, youth or transitioning adult to have an equal chance of being selected for the sample, all participants who fit the age requirement (0-21) will be eligible to be screened within the identified program within the system they are working with at the time of screening. They must also be entering the respective system via court order, referral, or walk-in.Foster care children/youth are not eligible to participate in the Vision 21: LSC study. Therefore, each participating study site must exclude foster care children/youth from screening. The local Department of Social Services cannot be engaged in human subjects research and provide permission for foster care children/youth to participate in the research. Similarly, children/youth in detention facilities who are in the custody of the state are also excluded from this study. , The pilot phase of the Vision 21: LSC project focuses on assessing three key components: (a) In-person training module, (b) Screening tool, and (c) Training Manual. Below is a list of questions for each these three areas of interest. Part I. In-person training module 1. Does the in-person training provide adequate instruction for administering the screening tool?Part II. Screening Tool (i.e., Virginia Victimization Screen)2. How many children or youth were offered the screening tool?a. Of these children and youth, how many were screened?3. To what extent, does the Virginia Victimization Screenàa. Identify childhood and youth exposure to crime/victimization?b. Identify behaviors and symptoms a child/youth may be currently experiencing (within the last 30 days)?c. Identify protective factors available to children and youth who have been screened? 4. Of those screened, how many children or youthàa. Did not receive an intervention and/or referral (i.e., screened negative)?b. Did receive an intervention and/or referral (i.e., screened positive)?5. Of those who screened positive, a.

            "Disclosure, socialization, and sex behaviors , The project will be a collaboration between the PI, co-PI, and the research team. All study personnel have completed and passed CITI training. Bi-weekly meetings will be held between member of the research team to insure all study personnel are informed about the protocol and their research-related duties and functions. Additional communications will occur via e-mail or phone. , Given the previously explored risks associated with incongruent sexual identity and same sex attraction or behaviors (e.g., suicidality, substance abuse, etc.), findings from this study could shed light on an important population that has been traditionally overlooked in the literature. By breaking down and examining pathways of sexual identity exploration, communication/disclosure, and self-efficacy, findings could greatly contribute to understanding of how social groups impact sexual health, as well as identify ways by which individuals engage in risk behaviors. , Recruitment is conducted completely through the SONA system. A brief description of study aims and the credit incentive will be listed in the SONA description for the study. Since psychology department students are already familiar with the SONA system, no outside advertisement will be needed for the recruitment. , The study has three primary aims: 1.) To investigate the relationship between sexual communication and disclosure practices, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual health behaviors and knowledge among individuals who experience same-sex attraction, 2.) To examine how attitudes about bisexuality affect sexual health practices and sexual disclosure, 3.) To determine if discrepancies between same-sex attraction and previous sexual history predict present sexual self-efficacy attitudes.\n",
            "MERC School Based Action Research Teams for Culturally Responsive Teaching , , One promising approach for addressing a broad range of disparities in educational outcomes across groups is the use of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) strategies that forefront student culture in the development of curriculum and delivery of instruction. Culturally responsive teachers view students cultural differences as assets in the learning process, rather than deficits that must be overcome as all students assimilate to the dominant culture (Gay, 2013). When teachers are well-equipped to foster inclusive and equitable classrooms, students from marginalized backgrounds show higher rates of academic achievement, motivation, self-confidence, and self-efficacy (Ladson-Billings, 1995; Dee & Penner, 2017 and Cabrera, Milem, Jaquette, & Marx, 2014). A recent systematic literature review of 37 independent studies that examined the student impacts of culturally relevant education (CRE) found that CRE can boost academic achievement (Aronson & Laughter, 2016). However, studies of the use of CRT in PK12 schools have shown that teacher confidence and skill in this approach is low (Lee, Luykx, Buxton, & Shaver, 2007), and that integration into the teaching and learning practices with schools is not widespread (Baeder, 2010; Yuan, 2010). Professional development (PD) for teachers and other school-based practitioners is a key lever for supporting schools as they promote CRT. This is especially true when considering the growing cultural mismatch between a diversifying student population and a teaching force that remains predominantly White and female (Villegas, Strom, & Lucas, 2012). Thus, the purpose of this exploratory study is to support the iterative development of a networked action research PD model designed to promote teachers ability to implement culturally responsive teaching in their classes. This project will contribute to the scientific knowledge base related to the following domains-Clearer understanding of what CRT looks like in classrooms and what practices constitute CRT.-Knowledge of how teachers develop CRT -Knowledge of how action research specifically helps teachers develop CRT-Evidence that stronger CRT enhances student outcomes-Understanding of how unique school and classroom contexts shape teachers' use of CRT, and professional growth in that area , Educator participants will be selected through the application process described in the prior section. The PIs will recruit participants by asking school principals to email a recruitment flyer to their whole staff and by delivering a presentation about the program to the whole school staff (see recruitment script). Potential participants will email the project PIs with any questions. Selection of participants will be conducted within one to two weeks after the application deadline. The PIs will select participants in consultation with the school administrators in order to ensure diversity of participants in terms of school subject taught, grade, teaching experience, and level of knowledge of CRT. , Specific Aim 1: Iteratively develop a PD model for CRT through an action research process that engages the perspectives of key stakeholders from HCPS and CCPS (e.g., teachers, administrators, students, and parents). (RQ 1) How are the SBARTs implemented across school contexts? (RQ 2) How do model-based factors influence the implementation? (RQ 3) How do school-based factors influence the implementation?Specific Aim 2: Examine the relationship between participation in the PD and teachers dispositions toward and knowledge of CRT. (RQ 4) What is the relationship between participation in a SBART and the development of teacher professional disposition, knowledge and skill related to CRT?Specific Aim 3: Examine the relationship between participation in the PD and changes in teachers CRT practices. (RQ 5) What is the relationship between participation in a SBART and changes to teacher professional practices with CRT?Specific Aim 4: Examine the relationship between teacher participation in the PD model and student learning outcomes. (RQ 6) What is the relationship between teacher participation on the SBART and the the social/emotional, behavioral and academic outcomes of students in the classes where the strategies are implemented?\n"
